Site Changes

I wrote this so I could track web comics that don't have an RSS feed.
It'll work for any website where the HTML is changing (ie not Flash or AJAX).

latest version is available from the git repository
http://www.chaosengine.net/git/site_changes.git/

report bugs, request features by emailing daniel@chaosengine.net

Example Usage:

One feed per site
site_changes.py -o /var/www/comics --page_link="http://www.example.com/comics/" --feed_per_site $HOME/site_changes/sites.cfg

One feed for all sites
site_changes.py -o /var/www/comics --page_title="Non-RSS Comics" --page_link="http://www.example.com/comics/" $HOME/site_changes/sites.cfg

use --keep_content to help work out why a page is changing every time you check
